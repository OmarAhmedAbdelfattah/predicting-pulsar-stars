The data about the Pulsars

Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produces radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate data sets as binary classification problems. 

Analysis the data and creating the required visualizations get the most important features
